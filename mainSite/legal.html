<br />

<br />
9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitation of Liability &ndash; Your attention is particularly drawn to the provisions of this condition<br />
<br />
9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save as provided at condition 9.3 our entire liability to you in respect of any claim whatsoever or breach by us of any of these terms and conditions shall be limited to the price paid for the Services.<br />
<br />

<br />
9.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you or a third party (not being a sub-contractor or other agent engaged by us) shall do or omit to do anything which results in us being unable to comply with our obligations to you then we will endeavour to inform you of this as soon as possible, in such a case:<br />
<br />
9.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we will have no liability arising as a result of any delay or failure in performing the Services; and<br />
<br />
9.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we will notify you whether we intend to make any claim for additional costs.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp; Indemnity<br />
<br />
10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shall indemnify us against all claims, costs and expenses incurred by us arising directly or indirectly from any breach by you of any of your obligations under these terms and conditions.<br />

<br />
11.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of any Services may be denied if you have not made payment for the Services or you are in breach of these terms and conditions.<br />
<br />
11.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have the right to suspend the provision of Services due to reasons beyond our reasonable control.<br />

<br />
12.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either party may terminate the supply of the Services upon giving to the other at least 10 Working Days&rsquo; notice before the 1st of the next billing month.<br />
<br />

<br />
13.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provisions of this condition 13 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any cancellation, suspension or termination of the Services.<br />
<br />
14.&nbsp; Force Majeure<br />
<br />
14.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any of our obligations if the delay or failure results from events or circumstances outside our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, strikes, lock outs, accidents, war, fire, the act or omission of government, highway authorities or any telecommunications carrier, operator or other authority, or the delay or failure in manufacture, production or supply by third parties of equipment or services.<br />
<br />
14.2&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall notify you of any such event falling under condition 14.1 above and the likely duration of such event.<br />
<br />
15.&nbsp; General<br />
<br />
15.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are not permitted to assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these terms and conditions without our prior written consent.&nbsp; In the case of a multi-user requirement for the Services the names listed on the requirement will be the only parties entitled to the Services unless otherwise agreed between us in writing.<br />
<br />
15.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any notice required to be given by either party to the other shall be served in writing to the address of the other party stated overleaf or such other address as such party may from time to time have communicated to the other in writing, and if sent by email shall unless the contrary is proved be deemed to be received on the day it was sent, if sent by fax shall be deemed to be served on receipt of an error free transmission report, if given by letter shall be deemed to have been served at the time at which the letter was delivered personally or if sent by post shall be deemed to have been delivered in the ordinary course of post.<br />
<br />
15.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure or delay by us in enforcing or partially enforcing any of these terms and conditions shall not be construed as a waiver of any of our rights under these terms and conditions.<br />
<br />
15.4&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties agree that all rights afforded to any third parties by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 shall be expressly excluded.<br />
<br />
15.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any provision of these terms and conditions is held by any competent authority to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part the provision shall be deemed severable and the validity of the other provisions of these terms and conditions shall not be affected thereby.<br />
