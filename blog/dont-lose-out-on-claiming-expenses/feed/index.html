		<description>Hello, thank you for your comment, and for correcting our information. We&#039;ve decided to re-write this point and cover a bit more about what can and cannot be claimed as expenses for a business. We&#039;ll be sure to triple check our sources for any further blog posts we make. The Old Church School :)</description>

		<description>Point 9 mentions not being able to claim expenses for vehicles that are not used solely for business. This is not correct. You can claim for a vehicle used partly for business and partly for private purposes as long as the amount claimed for business truly reflects the fair percentage of business use. For example if you use a vehicle 25% for business and 75% privately you can claim 25% of the vehicle expenses.</description>
