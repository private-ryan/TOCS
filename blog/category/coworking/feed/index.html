Great! However, what if you feel uncertain about how to proceed &#8211; in other words &#8211; how to get clients? As a new freelancer or business owner, you&#8217;re sure to be an eager beaver and get the concept of your business into a money making enterprise!  What are the pros and cons of starting out that face you as a newbie?<br />
</span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>First things first:</strong> Have you done your research? What are your rates? Will you charge for extra work? How do you want to get paid &#8211; hourly, on a day rate or per project? How will you agree to projects or set up appointments? Why not find out what the market average is in your area and charge a similar amount. If you&#8217;re going for high end work &#8211; do you charge clients more than the &#8216;going rate&#8217;?  Here is a great blog <a href="http://www.startups.co.uk/pricing-your-work.html">post </a>about  how to price your services. It has a comprehensive list of what to take into account. </span></span></p>
<p><strong>Know who you&#8217;re working for:</strong> As a fail-safe shouldn&#8217;t you have an idea of who it is you&#8217;re going to be working with for the next chapter in your life? Make sure you know the basics about your new customer. What is your client’s name? Registered business name? Billing address? Contact numbers? Email address? Make sure you share the same information about yourself in your contract as well; so the client knows where and when they can contact you. Why not mention what you don&#8217;t do &#8211; as well as what you do, do. That way you&#8217;re upfront from the beginning and not caught in the trap of doing work you don&#8217;t really want to be doing to stay afloat.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Contacting clients:</strong> How do you intend to communicate with clients? Email, postal docs, phone? Be aware that although email is the standard way of communicating (and can often be perceived as being informal), anything you say or agree to could be seen as being &#8216;set in stone&#8217;. This is a great<a href=" http://contractclarity.co.uk/articles/beware-the-binding-email/"> article</a> about email and the legal connotations to your written word!<br style="font-size: small;" /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Do you want to get paid at the end of the day?</strong> Do you let people tell you that you have to work for free or assign yourself to a low-paying job -  if you want to crack into your chosen industry?  If you don&#8217;t take the job, there well may be a hundred more freelancers behind you willing to take that position, so why not let them and hold out for something that you feel deserves your time and expertise?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>To do or not to do:</strong> Once you&#8217;ve started up, many friends and family will cotton on on the fact you have these skills and may suggest you &#8216;do them a favour&#8217;. No one can blame you for wanting to lend a hand to your family or &#8216;a friend of a friend&#8217;. But ask yourself this&#8230;Will you have a good word of mouth recommendation after the work is complete? Or will helping out a mate actually burn a friendship and end up with a job you&#8217;re not too happy with? Before you embark on this &#8216;informal&#8217; work, why not just put a few things in place to cover your back &#8211; and your client&#8217;s. That way you both know what to expect from one another. Some freelancers have told us how they&#8217;ve been burned by doing a favour for a friend, where sadly communications were misunderstood and they&#8217;ve not come out of the situation favourably through no fault of their own, other than that they didn&#8217;t treat it as a job. Have a look at these <a href="http://speckyboy.com/2010/08/12/5-free-to-use-freelance-design-contract-templates/">5 Free to Use Freelance Design Contract Templates</a> to figure out what suits you.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Why not start as you mean to go on:</strong> Be as professional as you can be. Make sure you understand and research common practices in your chosen freelancing industry. Check out these quick start guides<a href="http://freelancefolder.com/getting-started-guides/ "> here</a>.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Get paid for the time you put in:</strong> Should you include a retainer fee in a contract?  Don&#8217;t under estimate hours of concept time that you&#8217;ll put into a project at the beginning. An up front fee ensures that you are actually paid for all the work that you&#8217;ve done up to the point the client notifies you that they&#8217;re not going to continue on with the project. This could be down to any number of things &#8211; but you don&#8217;t want to end up forking out on the project only to have the rug pulled out from underneath you, with no job or money in the bank! Just because you are a fledgling in a world of established freelancers &#8211; doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t command respect from the get-go!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span><strong>Have you thought about insurance?</strong> Could the advice you give or work you do cause someone a mischief if interpreted the wrong way? It is always best to cover yourself &#8211; so your loved ones or dog won&#8217;t go hungry. Check out this <a href="http://3.kpsol.co.uk/what_insurances_do_i_need.html#do_i_really_need_insurance">link</a> to see an overview of the various types of insurance you may need as a Director, employer or freelancer. Check out this <a href="http://www.freelancesupermarket.com/resources/contractor-faqs/what-insurance-do-i-need/print.aspx ">list </a>for a breakdown of all things you may need to insure against as a small business owner!</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget the paperwork:</strong> HMRC related paperwork can build up before you you know it &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re an employer. Make sure you familiarise yourself with all that is required of you. Living the dream means being super responsible for it too. Here is a <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payerti/getting-started/paye-basics/rti.htm">guide</a> to the new &#8216;real time&#8217; PAYE basics.  These <a href="http://www.freelanceuk.com/news/3927.shtml">tips</a> are also useful for knowing what you need to think about when running your freelancing career.</p>

(Sponsored by Forward space).</p>
<p>Andreas attempts to represent the role of a non-player character in the modern world. He strikes a meditative position of inactiveness to address cultural tensions rather than dealing with subjective issues. His removal of negative and positive factors from his life creates a series of rituals revealing both the boredom and the promise of spiritual transcendence inherent in contemporary society.</p>
<p>Andreas’ current work addresses the apathy towards the gradual creep of technology inserting itself into our lives. It deals with the erosion of our primal desires by structural forces that make decisions on our behalf, slowly making the natural un-natural, and then through familiarity, natural once more. It explores the creation of a synthesized utopia of flavour, sight, sound and smell to produce organic fantasies that drive product purchases.</p>
<p>“We are touching a touch screen, but we’re also touched by it. The images I take in through the screen every day affect me in a bodily way, giving me sensations that remind me of others I’ve had &#8211; touching water, rocks, moss, etc. but intense in a different way – hyper-real, simulated, glossy…”</p>
<p>Andreas Ervik lives and works in Oslo, Norway. His practice swims between a digital and physical channel. In Intimate Knowledge at The Toolshed, we will see an installation of prints, video and sculptures that reflects our current fluid transitioning between physical and virtual habitats.</p>
<p>Recent solo exhibitions include, Philophopherph Phone at Sound of Mu, Oslo, 2011 and Learning to Love my Life as a Non-Player Character, Wizard Gallery, Oslo, 2012, as well as participating in the group show Metamorphosis, Revision Arts, NY. Andreas is also part of the collaborative blog project Jogging, and had works published in Pretty Ugly, Gestalten Verlag and OFluxo #1.</p>
<p>The Toolshed is a new art gallery based in Frome, Somerset. Into its second year, it will be hosting a program of five solo shows over the summer months.</p>

Some really useful tips and insights in to the world of finance options &#8211; as well as crowdfunding! Speakers Andrew Denham, founder of <a href="http://www.thebicycleacademy.org/">The Bicycle Academy </a>and our very own <a href="http://www.forwardspace.co.uk/">Gavin Eddy</a>  gave really helpful and strong advice to attendees looking for ways to further their businesses through an external finance route. We all received great handouts from Gavin, with up to date information about what was out there &#8211; as well as a few cheeky, yet very helpful hints on receiving credit from the banks out there. We&#8217;d also like to thank venue host Nikki Davey for her generous venue and time &#8211; and The Works Canteen, who once again delivered beautiful food to share with the informal networking after the talk had finished. Anyone with questions about finance can email us or contact <a href="http://www.burton-sweet.co.uk/">Burton Sweet</a> accountants who very generously said they&#8217;d help those who attended the talk with queries about their fiances. Get in touch if you want to know anything!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="294" height="659" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/facilitiesback.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="facilitiesback" title="facilitiesback" /></div><p>What attracts people to a co-working space like The Old Church School? The glass meeting rooms? The beautiful Herman Miller chairs? Our Mozzo Coffee? TILT Desk space and printing facilities? Actually most of the time, it is absolutely none of the above!</p>
<p>The desk space and office facilities we offer are secondary to how someone is feeling about their current work situation. For some; the need to get out of their current office rental or homeworking arrangement brings them to our front door, or a voice at the end of our telephone. Others are working from home and fancy a bit of balance with their work lifestyle. Some have been offered homeworking arrangements by the boss &#8211; that are too far away removed from the buzz of a more traditional work environment. We can&#8217;t say we are a traditional 9-5 office; because we simply are not.</p>
<p>We have Cake Wednesday &#8211; where each week we make cake to celebrate it being&#8230;well a Wednesday. We have competitions; community events; workshops; members events; National Chip Week celebrations; pop up restaurants in our meeting rooms; business festivals and bake offs. Traditional we may not be, but we understand why people need this stuff. Because at the end of the day, co-working actually provides much more emotional fulfillment than practical. <strong></strong></p>
<p>What members say they are interested in most when they sign up to rent desk space is a sense of community. Of belonging and knowing they are going through the same work or home difficulties as everyone else, even if it&#8217;s just checking in one day a month.</p>
<p>Desk space is obviously the practical reason for coming to us. But beneath this initial interest is a deeper process. An awareness and evaluation of holistic needs, not just desk space.</p>
<p>We are in no way saying homeworking is bad, it works for so many people and th<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/06/working-from-home-miss-office">e 5.4 million British households</a> with one or more occupants working from home is testament to how this working style can be a positive lifestyle choice. It&#8217;s simply for some, a change of scenery is the right path for them.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we offer free trail days &#8211; to everyone! If you feel it is not for you, great. You are a happy homeworker, or your office rental suits you just fine! If you want to come and work in our space, great! Welcome aboard. How can we help you? Cake?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="2165" height="3403" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/P1000989.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="P1000989" title="P1000989" /></div><p><a href="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/P10009891.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2139" title="P1000989" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/P10009891-190x300.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="300" /></a>As a small business you may have started out as a one man band operation and put in all the hours of hard graft to get the business doing well enough to grow and need staff to run your bigger empire. But how do you guarantee productivity and a workforce that care about the business as much as you do, in this new role of becoming an employer?</p>
<p><strong>Trust your instincts:</strong> Obviously you have to hire the right person; someone you feel will commit to the role and shows determination and passion in what they&#8217;re doing. As a small business owner, you also need to make sure the chemistry for working closely together is right. You can teach the right person how you want things to be done &#8211; you need to make sure you can work well together more than anything else. At Forward space we share desk space and so need to know that working in such close quarters with each-other means we can stand to be literally in each others face for 8 hours a day!</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t ask someone to do something you wouldn&#8217;t be prepared to do yourself:</strong> This doesn&#8217;t set your employees a good example and shows you have double standards. Do the job you want your employees to do! Be the example you want in your workplace, your employees will take note of how to conduct themselves and fit in with the tone of your organisation.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t &#8216;Dangle the Carrot&#8217;:</strong> How is that anyway to treat anybody? If you want a work force that respects you and works as hard as they can to get results or strive to continue on your success, then show them respect. If you&#8217;ve hired the right person in the first place &#8211; let them get on with their job. Standing over someone&#8217;s shoulders and telling them that they&#8217;re doing wrong is no way to instill confidence and initiative. Why not let employees learn from their own mistakes? Guaranteed they won&#8217;t do it again and you can support them through why whatever it was they did &#8211; didn&#8217;t work out.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it flat:</strong> Flat organisiations work really well because employees and employers can decide and collaborate on projects together. This gives your staff more power in how your company is run, and in-turn will make employees care about what they&#8217;re doing more &#8211; as they&#8217;ve made a decision in how/where to take the company forward. Listen to employees when they approach you with ideas or concerns. Acknowledge their feelings and show them that you value their input and experiences. This will ensure that any problems are dealt with openly and you can all trust each other to look out for one another!</p>
<p><strong> Empower learning:</strong> Why not ask your staff what they want to learn or what they think will make them do their job better? By bringing their interests into the mix, they&#8217;ll work even harder at the job in hand and appreciate you are interested in what they enjoy doing. This also gives them the confidence to reflect on their own strengths and weaknesses and consider what they need to work on to improve any skill gaps they might have.</p>
<p><strong>Reward the extra mile:</strong> If you feel your staff are working hard and putting in the time to get things and going above and beyond the call of duty then aknowledge their hard work and commitment to your company. You don&#8217;t have to pay huge bonuses and do crazy gestures of appreciation. Treating someone to a day out or lunch as a thank you can be enough to make someone feel valued and trusted in the job they do. As a small business you can&#8217;t afford a high turnover of staff, and so building a strong team is the most cost effective way of ensuring longevity from your staff and consistency for your customers.</p>
<p><strong>Always check in:</strong> Always ask how an employee&#8217;s day was and what they did that day &#8211; this way you can find out any issues and make sure they&#8217;re on track with their work. If they&#8217;re struggling with something find out why, do you have too many expectations of someone? or do they have things on their mind they just cant shift. We&#8217;re not saying that being lenient or a million miles away from what your employees get up to is the way to nurture staff, just trust the person you&#8217;ve hired to do their job well. They&#8217;ll want to prove to you they can full-fill your beliefs and achieve shared goals for the business. Giving someone an inch doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll always take a mile.</p>
