This will be the longest distance to date &#8211; of one of our Twinterviews. Jerome is a licensed architect and business owner. Jerome sharpened his design skills at <a href="http://www.clivewilkinson.com/story/whatwedo.html">Clive Wilkinson Architects (CWA)</a>; known worldwide for the design of <a href="http://www.clivewilkinson.com/work/google.html">Google&#8217;s office headquarters!</a> Jerome was BALNKSPACES first customer! He left the corporate worked to set up his own freelancing business and realised he needed a place to work which accommodated his time schedule &#8211; but wasn’t in coffee shops of from home. He realised he wanted and needed a high-tech, modern, professional workplace. He now runs a co-working space that is home to the greatest percentage of independent workers in the U.S!</span><em></em><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"> Zoikes!! If you have questions about co-working culture across the ocean or are just curious about how Jerome ended up where he is now, his idea and how he came to implement them &#8211; then <a href="https://twitter.com/OldChurchSchool">Tweet</a> us a question and we&#8217;ll be sure to ask! </span> </span></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="489" height="367" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/thetoolshed44602_233519630113789_143433590_n.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="thetoolshed44602_233519630113789_143433590_n" title="thetoolshed44602_233519630113789_143433590_n" /></div><p><a href="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/thetoolshed44602_233519630113789_143433590_n1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2346" title="thetoolshed44602_233519630113789_143433590_n" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/thetoolshed44602_233519630113789_143433590_n1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>The Toolshed is pleased to present the first UK solo show of works by Norwegian artist, Andreas Ervik. (Sponsored by Forward space).</p>
<p>Andreas attempts to represent the role of a non-player character in the modern world. He strikes a meditative position of inactiveness to address cultural tensions rather than dealing with subjective issues. His removal of negative and positive factors from his life creates a series of rituals revealing both the boredom and the promise of spiritual transcendence inherent in contemporary society.</p>
<p>Andreas’ current work addresses the apathy towards the gradual creep of technology inserting itself into our lives. It deals with the erosion of our primal desires by structural forces that make decisions on our behalf, slowly making the natural un-natural, and then through familiarity, natural once more. It explores the creation of a synthesized utopia of flavour, sight, sound and smell to produce organic fantasies that drive product purchases.</p>
<p>“We are touching a touch screen, but we’re also touched by it. The images I take in through the screen every day affect me in a bodily way, giving me sensations that remind me of others I’ve had &#8211; touching water, rocks, moss, etc. but intense in a different way – hyper-real, simulated, glossy…”</p>
<p>Andreas Ervik lives and works in Oslo, Norway. His practice swims between a digital and physical channel. In Intimate Knowledge at The Toolshed, we will see an installation of prints, video and sculptures that reflects our current fluid transitioning between physical and virtual habitats.</p>
<p>Recent solo exhibitions include, Philophopherph Phone at Sound of Mu, Oslo, 2011 and Learning to Love my Life as a Non-Player Character, Wizard Gallery, Oslo, 2012, as well as participating in the group show Metamorphosis, Revision Arts, NY. Andreas is also part of the collaborative blog project Jogging, and had works published in Pretty Ugly, Gestalten Verlag and OFluxo #1.</p>
<p>The Toolshed is a new art gallery based in Frome, Somerset. Into its second year, it will be hosting a program of five solo shows over the summer months.</p>

Some really useful tips and insights in to the world of finance options &#8211; as well as crowdfunding! Speakers Andrew Denham, founder of <a href="http://www.thebicycleacademy.org/">The Bicycle Academy </a>and our very own <a href="http://www.forwardspace.co.uk/">Gavin Eddy</a>  gave really helpful and strong advice to attendees looking for ways to further their businesses through an external finance route. We all received great handouts from Gavin, with up to date information about what was out there &#8211; as well as a few cheeky, yet very helpful hints on receiving credit from the banks out there. We&#8217;d also like to thank venue host Nikki Davey for her generous venue and time &#8211; and The Works Canteen, who once again delivered beautiful food to share with the informal networking after the talk had finished. Anyone with questions about finance can email us or contact <a href="http://www.burton-sweet.co.uk/">Burton Sweet</a> accountants who very generously said they&#8217;d help those who attended the talk with queries about their fiances. Get in touch if you want to know anything!</p>

We were there to cheer some friends on, standing on the beautiful streets of Bath on the chilly day of March 3rd (2013). As always the atmosphere was great and it was amazing to see so many people running for worthy causes as well as for fun.</p>
<p>We interviewed some participants and spectators who&#8217;d also taken part in the event, after the race and got us some good tips on how to enjoy a half marathon as a competitor. Something useful for our fellow TOCSters competing in the Frome Half Marathon later in the year?</p>
<p><strong>Before the event:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Get yourself ready to go:</strong> John, 65 (who has been running in the Bath Half for the last 33 years!), recommends training well for a whole year before the race; so you can do four months of half marathon style runs leading up to the day. This way you have a level of fitness that means you can stay at a consistent pace throughout and know your pace limit. &#8220;You minimise your risk of over exerting yourself at the beginning or end of the race by ensuring you&#8217;ve put the hours in. Also make sure you eat well; carbohydrate-rich foods like homemade bread, pasta and potatoes, are a great fuel for your body. Fruit, fruit juice, low-fat milk and yogurts are great treats to have in the last few weeks leading up to the race.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://fromerunningclub.org.uk/ ">Frome Running Club</a> and others like it can help you to map out a training plan for participating in a half or full marathon and can help you with diet tips too.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Fuel your brain as well as your body:</strong> This year the organisers let competitors listen to music in one headphone, so you could enjoy the experience a bit more; but could still be able to hear information from the events marshals. We talked to Joseph, 34 a Magazine Editor who has taken part in the race for the last 3 years. He recommends sorting out a play list the day before, with something cheery and upbeat to start with and as the race gets underway making sure you have some songs that spur you on &#8211; especially at the half way mark! Joe&#8217;s top tracks were &#8220;anything by the Pogues&#8221; at the start of the race &#8211; and then gearing your list to tracks such as &#8216;Run to the Hills&#8217; by Iron Maiden; &#8216;He&#8217;s Going the Distance&#8217; by Cake and &#8216;Road to No-where&#8217; By Talking Heads, quite an eclectic mix!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 3:</strong> <strong>Give yourself some TLC:</strong> Alice, 30 a Town Planner (who has taken part in the Bath Half for two year&#8217;s now) advises you look after yourself the week before.  &#8220;Make sure you look after your feet; get a nice pedicure and a massage. Wear those comfy trainers you&#8217;ve been training in, on the big day itself. Wear comfortable socks and don&#8217;t bother investing in anything new for the event &#8211; you&#8217;ll only end up doing yourself a mischief! Get an early night every night for a week leading up to the big day and definitely stay on the water the night before &#8211; you don&#8217;t want to be running with a headache or hangover!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: You are what you wear:</strong> If you know that a few &#8220;whoops&#8221; and cheers from the crowd will keep you going when you need it<span> &#8211; <span>p</span>ut your name on your vest! &#8220;<span>People watching the race are really supportive<span>, </span>especially in the <span>last mile and have great respect for you taking part. It&#8217;ll gi<span>ve you that last push you need and get the <span>adrenaline</span> going again! Also wear clothes that are made for running in, nothing too fancy &#8211; but anything heavy or pure cotton might give you a sore patch!</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>&#8221; Ian, 29 &#8211; a first timer this year!  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>On the day:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5:<strong> Always eat a good breakfast:</strong> </strong>Says Cameron 21 a Student: Get up early and eat at least two to three hours before the start time. This gives your body time to digest your meal and gives you the energy you need for the day ahead. You can feel quite nauseous after the event, so by looking after yourself you run less risk of fainting or being ill later that day.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 6:<strong> Stretch out any nerves:</strong> </strong>Rebekah, 52 said to make sure you warm up before the race &#8211; do some gentle exercise and stretches to prepare your body for the task ahead, that way you minimise the risk of pulling anything!</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Tip 7: <strong>Be prepared: </strong></strong>According to Anna, 28, it&#8217;s a great idea to take a bum-bag. &#8220;Fill it with the essential goodies; energy tablets or sweets and any vital medication you might need. There are stops for you to have a drink &#8211; but it&#8217;s best to take a small bottle if you know running makes you thirsty. Don&#8217;t over do the water though, just go by what you&#8217;ve needed when training &#8211; otherwise you&#8217;ll get caught at the roadside if you can&#8217;t cross your legs any longer!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><strong></strong></strong><strong><strong>Tip 8:</strong> Steady on:</strong> Mary, 43 says that keeping the same pace throughout is her key tip! She&#8217;s taken part for two year&#8217;s now and really enjoys the atmosphere of the event. &#8220;If you start of slow then you lose precious time at the beginning and may find it hard to make up those lost minutes during the race. If you can, maintain a good solid pace all the way to the finish line. It&#8217;s no easy task, but if you put in the practice it&#8217;s the best way to perform on the day! You don&#8217;t need to do a rush at the end when you&#8217;re feeling tired if you&#8217;ve managed to do the same pace all along and keep an eye on the time (if it&#8217;s important to you!).&#8221;<br clear="all" /><br />
<strong>Tip 9: Find a friend:</strong> Jen, 36:  &#8220;If it&#8217;s your first time and you&#8217;re a bit nervous, buddy up with someone you know who is also taking part. If you need to stop don&#8217;t just stop running whilst in the crowd &#8211; as you&#8217;ll end up hurting yourself and others. Instead make a beeline for the pavement and take a short rest if you&#8217;re starting to feel overwhelmed. Take off any unwanted layers too. Organisers recommend you buy an old sweatshirt or top from a charity shop and leave these items on the pavement for volunteers and marshals to collect after the event is over. These are then recycled. Some people use black bin-liners, but this can make running uncomfortable and you can get them wrapped around your legs when taking them off, not a good look!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>After the event:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tip 10: Know where to go:</strong> Tom 33, says his best tip is to arrange to meet your friends and family at the end (before you start the race). This doesn&#8217;t have to be at the finish line &#8211; as this can be quite a hectic spot. &#8220;Choose somewhere near by that is easily accessible, this way you can relax and take your time getting there. Having family keep hold of your belongings means that if it&#8217;s cold like it was this year, then you have an instant change of clothes and can cool down with out freezing your legs off!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tip 11: Cool down slowly:</strong> Be sure to keep moving after the race. Go for a little walk and keep stretching to make sure you gently let your body recover. Sip some water and wind down slowly. If you feel up to it have a light lunch and then rest. After you feel better go for a little walk again to keep things moving. &#8220;Don&#8217;t drink alcohol for a good few hours afterwards &#8211; your body will need time to rehydrate itself. I made the mistake of having a couple of pints to celebrate my victory and deeply regretted it later. I was in bed the rest of the afternoon with a headache, that was many years ago &#8211; and I&#8217;ve not competed since!&#8221; Peter, 50, a Partner in a regional Law firm.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="1401" height="1108" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Discuss-Do-Logos.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Discuss &amp; Do Logos" title="Discuss &amp; Do Logos" /></div><p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">What can we say about the Discuss and Do Watertight marketing workshop last night? It was fantastic!  We feel so fortunate to have had Bryony Thomas involved in the festival. Her strong message; about doing specific but manageable exercises to ensure the small business owner is in control and understands what strategy and direction is needed to take with business marketing, was easily digestible. Each attendee came away with a definite journey ahead. The audience left the event excited and enthusiastic about what had previously been a daunting task. Feedback we have received about the event has been fantastic. We all received a copy of her new book Watertight Marketing &#8211; Delivering long term sales results, and I know w few of us started reading it last night! </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Highly recommend this book! <img title="Watertight Marketing" src="http://www.bryonythomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/watertight-marketing-cover-240x360.jpg" alt="Watertight Marketing" width="240" height="360" /></span></span></p>

Nick was clearly very passionate about DUO and how customers felt about the brand. He demonstrated really well, how DUO reflected all the core values staff felt about the business &#8211; making sure that this translated in to how the company throughout engaged with the customer to ensure these values were felt by all experiencing the DUO brand. Nick advised small business owners and freelancers in the room, to stick to your heritage &#8211; why you started the business and to make sure your values were reflected throughout every action and decision made by the business. Know your USP; but be sure not to isolate anyone who may admire or buy in to your brand. We enjoyed a great visual presentation, with insight into what inspired the company and how you can look at what you are doing in or with your business to ensure that your brand reputation says what it was you set out to do &#8211; whether you are engaging physically with products; services; information or digitally &#8211; you can ensure that you convey a strong message and image to your customers that your good reputation is your brand and the way you believe in business! Ryan our apprentice was on hand to deliver top notch tech support and The Works Canteen provided generous nibbles and drinks for informal networking after the event. Gavin &#8211; as ever gave a great intro the our Keynote speaker Nick, who we feel fortunate to have had involved in the Discuss and Do festival. He was a very passionate and genuine speaker.</p>

We really enjoyed the first topic &#8216;Women in Business&#8217;  (25/01/13) and the insightful contributions Margaret Heffernan shared in the event. The lunch was a full of great conversation and Margaret showed her experience and business aptitude with advice and conversation throughout. The talk was just as inspiring &#8211; with great questions form the audience. Margaret demonstrated her wealth of knowledge about the subject and how women bring a more emotional intelligence to the business community of today. We feel very fortunate to have had someone of Margaret&#8217;s professional expertise and credentials involved in the festival and we&#8217;re looking forward to the publication of her next book! Our favourite advice over lunch was concerning the delegation to staff when running a small business and how if you don&#8217;t trust your employees to do their job then &#8220;your business will never be smarter than you are!&#8221;</p>
