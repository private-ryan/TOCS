This will be the longest distance to date &#8211; of one of our Twinterviews. Jerome is a licensed architect and business owner. Jerome sharpened his design skills at <a href="http://www.clivewilkinson.com/story/whatwedo.html">Clive Wilkinson Architects (CWA)</a>; known worldwide for the design of <a href="http://www.clivewilkinson.com/work/google.html">Google&#8217;s office headquarters!</a> Jerome was BALNKSPACES first customer! He left the corporate worked to set up his own freelancing business and realised he needed a place to work which accommodated his time schedule &#8211; but wasn’t in coffee shops of from home. He realised he wanted and needed a high-tech, modern, professional workplace. He now runs a co-working space that is home to the greatest percentage of independent workers in the U.S!</span><em></em><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"> Zoikes!! If you have questions about co-working culture across the ocean or are just curious about how Jerome ended up where he is now, his idea and how he came to implement them &#8211; then <a href="https://twitter.com/OldChurchSchool">Tweet</a> us a question and we&#8217;ll be sure to ask! </span> </span></span></p>

(Sponsored by Forward space).</p>
<p>Andreas attempts to represent the role of a non-player character in the modern world. He strikes a meditative position of inactiveness to address cultural tensions rather than dealing with subjective issues. His removal of negative and positive factors from his life creates a series of rituals revealing both the boredom and the promise of spiritual transcendence inherent in contemporary society.</p>
<p>Andreas’ current work addresses the apathy towards the gradual creep of technology inserting itself into our lives. It deals with the erosion of our primal desires by structural forces that make decisions on our behalf, slowly making the natural un-natural, and then through familiarity, natural once more. It explores the creation of a synthesized utopia of flavour, sight, sound and smell to produce organic fantasies that drive product purchases.</p>
<p>“We are touching a touch screen, but we’re also touched by it. The images I take in through the screen every day affect me in a bodily way, giving me sensations that remind me of others I’ve had &#8211; touching water, rocks, moss, etc. but intense in a different way – hyper-real, simulated, glossy…”</p>
<p>Andreas Ervik lives and works in Oslo, Norway. His practice swims between a digital and physical channel. In Intimate Knowledge at The Toolshed, we will see an installation of prints, video and sculptures that reflects our current fluid transitioning between physical and virtual habitats.</p>
<p>Recent solo exhibitions include, Philophopherph Phone at Sound of Mu, Oslo, 2011 and Learning to Love my Life as a Non-Player Character, Wizard Gallery, Oslo, 2012, as well as participating in the group show Metamorphosis, Revision Arts, NY. Andreas is also part of the collaborative blog project Jogging, and had works published in Pretty Ugly, Gestalten Verlag and OFluxo #1.</p>
<p>The Toolshed is a new art gallery based in Frome, Somerset. Into its second year, it will be hosting a program of five solo shows over the summer months.</p>

Some really useful tips and insights in to the world of finance options &#8211; as well as crowdfunding! Speakers Andrew Denham, founder of <a href="http://www.thebicycleacademy.org/">The Bicycle Academy </a>and our very own <a href="http://www.forwardspace.co.uk/">Gavin Eddy</a>  gave really helpful and strong advice to attendees looking for ways to further their businesses through an external finance route. We all received great handouts from Gavin, with up to date information about what was out there &#8211; as well as a few cheeky, yet very helpful hints on receiving credit from the banks out there. We&#8217;d also like to thank venue host Nikki Davey for her generous venue and time &#8211; and The Works Canteen, who once again delivered beautiful food to share with the informal networking after the talk had finished. Anyone with questions about finance can email us or contact <a href="http://www.burton-sweet.co.uk/">Burton Sweet</a> accountants who very generously said they&#8217;d help those who attended the talk with queries about their fiances. Get in touch if you want to know anything!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="1401" height="1108" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Discuss-Do-Logos.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Discuss &amp; Do Logos" title="Discuss &amp; Do Logos" /></div><p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">What can we say about the Discuss and Do Watertight marketing workshop last night? It was fantastic!  We feel so fortunate to have had Bryony Thomas involved in the festival. Her strong message; about doing specific but manageable exercises to ensure the small business owner is in control and understands what strategy and direction is needed to take with business marketing, was easily digestible. Each attendee came away with a definite journey ahead. The audience left the event excited and enthusiastic about what had previously been a daunting task. Feedback we have received about the event has been fantastic. We all received a copy of her new book Watertight Marketing &#8211; Delivering long term sales results, and I know w few of us started reading it last night! </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Highly recommend this book! <img title="Watertight Marketing" src="http://www.bryonythomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/watertight-marketing-cover-240x360.jpg" alt="Watertight Marketing" width="240" height="360" /></span></span></p>

Nick was clearly very passionate about DUO and how customers felt about the brand. He demonstrated really well, how DUO reflected all the core values staff felt about the business &#8211; making sure that this translated in to how the company throughout engaged with the customer to ensure these values were felt by all experiencing the DUO brand. Nick advised small business owners and freelancers in the room, to stick to your heritage &#8211; why you started the business and to make sure your values were reflected throughout every action and decision made by the business. Know your USP; but be sure not to isolate anyone who may admire or buy in to your brand. We enjoyed a great visual presentation, with insight into what inspired the company and how you can look at what you are doing in or with your business to ensure that your brand reputation says what it was you set out to do &#8211; whether you are engaging physically with products; services; information or digitally &#8211; you can ensure that you convey a strong message and image to your customers that your good reputation is your brand and the way you believe in business! Ryan our apprentice was on hand to deliver top notch tech support and The Works Canteen provided generous nibbles and drinks for informal networking after the event. Gavin &#8211; as ever gave a great intro the our Keynote speaker Nick, who we feel fortunate to have had involved in the Discuss and Do festival. He was a very passionate and genuine speaker.</p>

We really enjoyed the first topic &#8216;Women in Business&#8217;  (25/01/13) and the insightful contributions Margaret Heffernan shared in the event. The lunch was a full of great conversation and Margaret showed her experience and business aptitude with advice and conversation throughout. The talk was just as inspiring &#8211; with great questions form the audience. Margaret demonstrated her wealth of knowledge about the subject and how women bring a more emotional intelligence to the business community of today. We feel very fortunate to have had someone of Margaret&#8217;s professional expertise and credentials involved in the festival and we&#8217;re looking forward to the publication of her next book! Our favourite advice over lunch was concerning the delegation to staff when running a small business and how if you don&#8217;t trust your employees to do their job then &#8220;your business will never be smarter than you are!&#8221;</p>
