			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="1990" height="2653" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1000491.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="P1000491" title="P1000491" /></div><p><strong><a href="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1000488.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1813" title="P1000488" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/P1000488-300x204.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="204" /></a>Co-working is no longer seen as a fad, or an alternative way of working. It is now thought of as lasting change in the world of work – an answer to a greater need for companies to be flexible with workers and family life. Most users of co-working spaces are self-employed, however larger businesses and charities can see the benefit of a local work station for an employee within their organisation.</strong></p>
<p>So how does a co-working space pay back what you spend on office space?</p>
<p>1. <strong>Great minds think alike</strong>: In a co-working space you are more likely to come across those with similar core values. Often like-minded people attract others and so a synergy can be established more quickly and with more ease. Though the types of businesses themselves may be quite diverse – it&#8217;s the kindred mind of the business owner/s that enables these lasting connections to be forged.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Outreach</strong><strong>:</strong> Co-working spaces (in almost any location) are likely to embrace their town and get on board with projects and issues at a local level. Not only creating a supportive community within the hub, but an arm round other communities, building lasting positive relationships.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Safety in Numbers</strong>: Social networks as well as professional contacts are expanded thus opening up multiple channels and opportunities to collaborate, share or develop ideas – not only with other space users, but external acquaintances too. Many small and micro businesses say they experience noticeable growth after signing up to a space.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Time is money</strong>: Many co-workers have reported back to us that they find they wait less time to be paid when collaborating on a project with other members; meaning they can jump into the next project more easily, get recommendations and have higher job satisfaction.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Feels like home</strong>: Home working can often feel (at times) <a href="http://www.workfromhomewisdom.com/work-from-home-events/coworking-home-workers-freelancers/">isolating</a>, so co-working spaces offer a new environment and support network for the remote or independent worker. Co-working is often found to increase productivity for homeworkers &#8211; who frequently dabble in a space.</p>
<p>6.<strong>Inspired and motivated</strong>: As members don&#8217;t have to stick to &#8216;traditional&#8217; working hours, freelancers can choose their hours to suit how they work. Often meaning that working in a co-working space leads to more productivity &#8211; just by the flexibility it offers. Co-working spaces are often open places, where information and chit-chat is shared freely; thus members feel supported and feel more confident to make business decisions. <a href="http://www.deskmag.com/en/advantages-of-coworkig-spaces-over-traditional-and-home-offices-581)">“Compared to a traditional office, the majority of co-workers report an increase in self-confidence &#8211; almost 90%!” </a></p>
<p>7.<strong> Sharpen your skill set</strong>: Being surrounded by so many creative and knowledgeable people can mean you learn about info and other industries without even realising it. Members can often freely approach others for advice and so before you know it you&#8217;ve added more strings to your bow. This means you can produce better work for clients and even increase your going rate!</p>

<p>Kit Kilne runs a technology consultancy business offering: IT strategy and planning, Technical architecture, systems engineering and delivery management and Bespoke application development and support. With a strong focus on non-profit organisations but also work in the private and public sector.</p>
<p>Kit is looking to form a long term relationship with a freelance developer to provide extra capacity for current application development contracts. The volume of work will fluctuate but be of the order of 2 days per week for at least the next 6 months.

<div>
<div title="Page 1">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Freelance contract: Although I is not looking to directly employ staff one of the pleasures for me, in work, is forming long term relationships with good people and a long-term freelance association would work well</li>

</div>
<div><strong>Personality required:</strong></div>
<div>
<div title="Page 1">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Most importantly you need to be a highly competent and experienced developer – a self-starter, good at working independently and solving issues, You will have a number of years’ experience and have current work you could describe or show me.</li>
<li> Good communication and customer skills are essential so that, after an introductory period, I can have you work directly with clients.</li>
