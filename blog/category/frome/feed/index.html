This will be the longest distance to date &#8211; of one of our Twinterviews. Jerome is a licensed architect and business owner. Jerome sharpened his design skills at <a href="http://www.clivewilkinson.com/story/whatwedo.html">Clive Wilkinson Architects (CWA)</a>; known worldwide for the design of <a href="http://www.clivewilkinson.com/work/google.html">Google&#8217;s office headquarters!</a> Jerome was BALNKSPACES first customer! He left the corporate worked to set up his own freelancing business and realised he needed a place to work which accommodated his time schedule &#8211; but wasn’t in coffee shops of from home. He realised he wanted and needed a high-tech, modern, professional workplace. He now runs a co-working space that is home to the greatest percentage of independent workers in the U.S!</span><em></em><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"> Zoikes!! If you have questions about co-working culture across the ocean or are just curious about how Jerome ended up where he is now, his idea and how he came to implement them &#8211; then <a href="https://twitter.com/OldChurchSchool">Tweet</a> us a question and we&#8217;ll be sure to ask! </span> </span></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="1200" height="800" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_6757.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="IMG_6757" title="IMG_6757" /></div><h2><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1020242.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1064" title="P1020242" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1020242-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>So you&#8217;ve decided to start your own business&#8230;You want the benefits of running your own time; flexibility of family life balance; work space; environment and to pursue a career around your interests. Great! However, what if you feel uncertain about how to proceed &#8211; in other words &#8211; how to get clients? As a new freelancer or business owner, you&#8217;re sure to be an eager beaver and get the concept of your business into a money making enterprise!  What are the pros and cons of starting out that face you as a newbie?<br />
</span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>First things first:</strong> Have you done your research? What are your rates? Will you charge for extra work? How do you want to get paid &#8211; hourly, on a day rate or per project? How will you agree to projects or set up appointments? Why not find out what the market average is in your area and charge a similar amount. If you&#8217;re going for high end work &#8211; do you charge clients more than the &#8216;going rate&#8217;?  Here is a great blog <a href="http://www.startups.co.uk/pricing-your-work.html">post </a>about  how to price your services. It has a comprehensive list of what to take into account. </span></span></p>
<p><strong>Know who you&#8217;re working for:</strong> As a fail-safe shouldn&#8217;t you have an idea of who it is you&#8217;re going to be working with for the next chapter in your life? Make sure you know the basics about your new customer. What is your client’s name? Registered business name? Billing address? Contact numbers? Email address? Make sure you share the same information about yourself in your contract as well; so the client knows where and when they can contact you. Why not mention what you don&#8217;t do &#8211; as well as what you do, do. That way you&#8217;re upfront from the beginning and not caught in the trap of doing work you don&#8217;t really want to be doing to stay afloat.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Contacting clients:</strong> How do you intend to communicate with clients? Email, postal docs, phone? Be aware that although email is the standard way of communicating (and can often be perceived as being informal), anything you say or agree to could be seen as being &#8216;set in stone&#8217;. This is a great<a href=" http://contractclarity.co.uk/articles/beware-the-binding-email/"> article</a> about email and the legal connotations to your written word!<br style="font-size: small;" /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Do you want to get paid at the end of the day?</strong> Do you let people tell you that you have to work for free or assign yourself to a low-paying job -  if you want to crack into your chosen industry?  If you don&#8217;t take the job, there well may be a hundred more freelancers behind you willing to take that position, so why not let them and hold out for something that you feel deserves your time and expertise?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>To do or not to do:</strong> Once you&#8217;ve started up, many friends and family will cotton on on the fact you have these skills and may suggest you &#8216;do them a favour&#8217;. No one can blame you for wanting to lend a hand to your family or &#8216;a friend of a friend&#8217;. But ask yourself this&#8230;Will you have a good word of mouth recommendation after the work is complete? Or will helping out a mate actually burn a friendship and end up with a job you&#8217;re not too happy with? Before you embark on this &#8216;informal&#8217; work, why not just put a few things in place to cover your back &#8211; and your client&#8217;s. That way you both know what to expect from one another. Some freelancers have told us how they&#8217;ve been burned by doing a favour for a friend, where sadly communications were misunderstood and they&#8217;ve not come out of the situation favourably through no fault of their own, other than that they didn&#8217;t treat it as a job. Have a look at these <a href="http://speckyboy.com/2010/08/12/5-free-to-use-freelance-design-contract-templates/">5 Free to Use Freelance Design Contract Templates</a> to figure out what suits you.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Why not start as you mean to go on:</strong> Be as professional as you can be. Make sure you understand and research common practices in your chosen freelancing industry. Check out these quick start guides<a href="http://freelancefolder.com/getting-started-guides/ "> here</a>.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Get paid for the time you put in:</strong> Should you include a retainer fee in a contract?  Don&#8217;t under estimate hours of concept time that you&#8217;ll put into a project at the beginning. An up front fee ensures that you are actually paid for all the work that you&#8217;ve done up to the point the client notifies you that they&#8217;re not going to continue on with the project. This could be down to any number of things &#8211; but you don&#8217;t want to end up forking out on the project only to have the rug pulled out from underneath you, with no job or money in the bank! Just because you are a fledgling in a world of established freelancers &#8211; doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t command respect from the get-go!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span><strong>Have you thought about insurance?</strong> Could the advice you give or work you do cause someone a mischief if interpreted the wrong way? It is always best to cover yourself &#8211; so your loved ones or dog won&#8217;t go hungry. Check out this <a href="http://3.kpsol.co.uk/what_insurances_do_i_need.html#do_i_really_need_insurance">link</a> to see an overview of the various types of insurance you may need as a Director, employer or freelancer. Check out this <a href="http://www.freelancesupermarket.com/resources/contractor-faqs/what-insurance-do-i-need/print.aspx ">list </a>for a breakdown of all things you may need to insure against as a small business owner!</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget the paperwork:</strong> HMRC related paperwork can build up before you you know it &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re an employer. Make sure you familiarise yourself with all that is required of you. Living the dream means being super responsible for it too. Here is a <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payerti/getting-started/paye-basics/rti.htm">guide</a> to the new &#8216;real time&#8217; PAYE basics.  These <a href="http://www.freelanceuk.com/news/3927.shtml">tips</a> are also useful for knowing what you need to think about when running your freelancing career.</p>

(Sponsored by Forward space).</p>
<p>Andreas attempts to represent the role of a non-player character in the modern world. He strikes a meditative position of inactiveness to address cultural tensions rather than dealing with subjective issues. His removal of negative and positive factors from his life creates a series of rituals revealing both the boredom and the promise of spiritual transcendence inherent in contemporary society.</p>
<p>Andreas’ current work addresses the apathy towards the gradual creep of technology inserting itself into our lives. It deals with the erosion of our primal desires by structural forces that make decisions on our behalf, slowly making the natural un-natural, and then through familiarity, natural once more. It explores the creation of a synthesized utopia of flavour, sight, sound and smell to produce organic fantasies that drive product purchases.</p>
<p>“We are touching a touch screen, but we’re also touched by it. The images I take in through the screen every day affect me in a bodily way, giving me sensations that remind me of others I’ve had &#8211; touching water, rocks, moss, etc. but intense in a different way – hyper-real, simulated, glossy…”</p>
<p>Andreas Ervik lives and works in Oslo, Norway. His practice swims between a digital and physical channel. In Intimate Knowledge at The Toolshed, we will see an installation of prints, video and sculptures that reflects our current fluid transitioning between physical and virtual habitats.</p>
<p>Recent solo exhibitions include, Philophopherph Phone at Sound of Mu, Oslo, 2011 and Learning to Love my Life as a Non-Player Character, Wizard Gallery, Oslo, 2012, as well as participating in the group show Metamorphosis, Revision Arts, NY. Andreas is also part of the collaborative blog project Jogging, and had works published in Pretty Ugly, Gestalten Verlag and OFluxo #1.</p>
<p>The Toolshed is a new art gallery based in Frome, Somerset. Into its second year, it will be hosting a program of five solo shows over the summer months.</p>

Some really useful tips and insights in to the world of finance options &#8211; as well as crowdfunding! Speakers Andrew Denham, founder of <a href="http://www.thebicycleacademy.org/">The Bicycle Academy </a>and our very own <a href="http://www.forwardspace.co.uk/">Gavin Eddy</a>  gave really helpful and strong advice to attendees looking for ways to further their businesses through an external finance route. We all received great handouts from Gavin, with up to date information about what was out there &#8211; as well as a few cheeky, yet very helpful hints on receiving credit from the banks out there. We&#8217;d also like to thank venue host Nikki Davey for her generous venue and time &#8211; and The Works Canteen, who once again delivered beautiful food to share with the informal networking after the talk had finished. Anyone with questions about finance can email us or contact <a href="http://www.burton-sweet.co.uk/">Burton Sweet</a> accountants who very generously said they&#8217;d help those who attended the talk with queries about their fiances. Get in touch if you want to know anything!</p>

It was fantastic!  We feel so fortunate to have had Bryony Thomas involved in the festival. Her strong message; about doing specific but manageable exercises to ensure the small business owner is in control and understands what strategy and direction is needed to take with business marketing, was easily digestible. Each attendee came away with a definite journey ahead. The audience left the event excited and enthusiastic about what had previously been a daunting task. Feedback we have received about the event has been fantastic. We all received a copy of her new book Watertight Marketing &#8211; Delivering long term sales results, and I know w few of us started reading it last night! </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Highly recommend this book! <img title="Watertight Marketing" src="http://www.bryonythomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/watertight-marketing-cover-240x360.jpg" alt="Watertight Marketing" width="240" height="360" /></span></span></p>

Nick was clearly very passionate about DUO and how customers felt about the brand. He demonstrated really well, how DUO reflected all the core values staff felt about the business &#8211; making sure that this translated in to how the company throughout engaged with the customer to ensure these values were felt by all experiencing the DUO brand. Nick advised small business owners and freelancers in the room, to stick to your heritage &#8211; why you started the business and to make sure your values were reflected throughout every action and decision made by the business. Know your USP; but be sure not to isolate anyone who may admire or buy in to your brand. We enjoyed a great visual presentation, with insight into what inspired the company and how you can look at what you are doing in or with your business to ensure that your brand reputation says what it was you set out to do &#8211; whether you are engaging physically with products; services; information or digitally &#8211; you can ensure that you convey a strong message and image to your customers that your good reputation is your brand and the way you believe in business! Ryan our apprentice was on hand to deliver top notch tech support and The Works Canteen provided generous nibbles and drinks for informal networking after the event. Gavin &#8211; as ever gave a great intro the our Keynote speaker Nick, who we feel fortunate to have had involved in the Discuss and Do festival. He was a very passionate and genuine speaker.</p>
