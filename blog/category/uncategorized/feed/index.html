			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="294" height="606" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/aboutback.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="aboutback" title="aboutback" /></div><p><strong><a href="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/resourcesback.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2171" title="resourcesback" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/resourcesback-147x300.jpg" alt="" width="147" height="300" /></a>What is it?</strong> <em>Coworking</em> is working alongside other professionals in a shared environment, often an office or workhub. Who&#8217;s it for? Homeworkers, contractors, consultants, freelancers, or those who travel frequently and need a flexible space to check in to when working away from the usual office location.<br />
<strong><br />
So what&#8217;s helped this new world of work?</strong> New technologies; cloud computing; more entrepreneurs and the self-employed. Redundancy has caused a new wave of people setting up their own business to procure work from companies forced to outsource through economic constraints.  Remote workers for larger companies and flexi-time means greater demand for flexible work arrangements and firms looking for cheap office costs has all meant that co-working is in more demand than ever before!<br />
<strong><br />
How does it work? </strong>Firstly a &#8216;Host&#8217; or space a manger will provide  you with the basic know-how on facilities available to you. They work hard to achieve the right atmosphere for you to get work done, take care of your clients, and make sure you get to know everyone around you &#8211; it&#8217;s never easy being the newbie, but fear not, you won&#8217;t be the newcomer for long! Tariffs for time at the hub or space are flexible and a good Host will make sure you&#8217;re on the right tariff that suits you!<br />
<strong><br />
Why does it work? </strong>Tariffs are transparent in what you get for desk space and services. Invoicing is slick and therefore works for all business models. There are no up-front deposits or contracts, so if you change your mind just tell your Host and they&#8217;ll understand. If you want to chum up with a friend and do your work on the cheap, then an open plan space is perfect for accommodating your needs. You can choose if you want the extras, or leave them if they are unnecessary for your business.<br />
<strong><br />
What&#8217;s the razzledazzle?</strong> Co-working is all about community. It beats the loan office owner having to frequent stiff networking events to meet other entrepreneurs and freelancers in the area. Co-working means you&#8217;re networking without even noticing! Being amongst a group of diverse people in one space means effortless connections are made and the quality of work your co-workers do, is right in front of your eyes! Co-working is attractive to many independent small businesses because it means you can easily outsource any work or skills you don&#8217;t have. It also means your carbon footprint is reduced, as you can usually walk to your nearest workhub and reduce time and money wasted on commuting.<br />
<strong><br />
Collaborate or Competition? </strong><br />
Many people wonder how co-working can actually work. Surrounded by others who may want the same job or project you do &#8211; especially if you are from the same town. By collaborating with others in a shared space you get a wealth of knowledge on your doorstep to tap into. By collaborating with any potential &#8216;competitors&#8217; you switch the focus onto passion for the project and meeting client needs, which more often than not lead to bigger opportunities for new and larger projects &#8211; that you might not have been able to take on by your self.  We find collaboration<strong> </strong>works better than competing against other co-workers because working closely with others in different fields, means you can go for those bigger projects without the worries of biting off more than you can chew or hiring staff to cope with demand. Co-working means that you&#8217;ll know who you complement and you can see their work before calling them onto a project. So this in turn takes up less time, money and other resources for your small business.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="521" height="652" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/brand-me1.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="brand me" title="brand me" /></div><p><strong>Branding</strong></p>
<p>Luke Manning Creative Director <a href="http://www.pencilstudio.co.uk/">Pencil Studio Ltd</a> is our guest blogger, giving us wise words on how to create the prefect brand for your small business!</p>
<p>A brand is much more than a logo or identity: it’s more complex than a set of colours or choice of font. True, all of these play a part in building a brand with consistency but what really makes a “brand”? Every day we are bombarded with adverts, packaging and literature, but what companies stick in our minds-which ones do we buy into? A lot of what we decide to purchase in life, be it a car or a soft drink is down to our choice of lifestyle. A good example of this is Innocent Smoothies, we all love the naive approach to the design and you warm to the character and tone of voice of the packaging. You feel that you are buying a quality product from a small company. It’s easy to forget that they are owned by Coca Cola! So why is branding important, especially to smaller businesses? The answer is we all need to have a face to what we do, to express who we are and the kind of businesses we run.  This is achieved by ensuring you brand yourselves correctly, it doesn&#8217;t mean packaging yourself in a manner which is not true or does not fully represent your business. It means playing on your strengths! If your clients like the fact that you are easy to work with, friendly and approachable; then this is a key element to build your brand. Use a friendly tone of voice in your writing, use approachable colours and images that are real and not from a loyalty free photo library because they look professional, as these just look fake. If your business is respected for being a straight cut, professional outfit who handles their clients with a no fuss business approach; then let this be the foundations in which your brand is developed. To sum it up briefly, branding is about developing a personality for your company.  Like people they all have them, it’s just finding out what yours is, then nurturing it and using it to your advantage.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were really pleased with the amount of interest we had about the Communicating Anger and Emotion workshop with Mark Urry, 2 June 2011. As the words “anger management” can evoke mixed and sometimes negative responses. However as Mark illustrated well through his presentation, anger is something that resides in all of us and is a perfectly normal feeling; it’s how you communicate these feelings that are important and essential within the working environment. The talk touched on various types of anger that exist and ways in which they manifest themselves; which was insightful and thought provoking, making us all consider if ourselves or others that we know display these traits. We were surprised to learn that 1 in 6 workers experience depression, anxiety or stress which costs the UK economy £26 Billion each year. Because anger and mental health in the work place is often left unaddressed, the charity Mind have started a campaign to highlight mental health in the workplace “The elephant in the room” will help people understand and start talking about the costs of neglecting mental wellbeing in the workplace.&lt;!&#8211;more&#8211;&gt; Mark himself was very passionate about this subject and it was clear Mark is committed to changing the negative association with anger and misconceptions that arise when the words “anger management” are spoken.  The talk delivered some key issues surrounding anger and how we can change our thinking pattern to learn new skill sets in order to communicate more effectively with others and to be more in tune with ourselves and how we feel about work commitments, colleagues and personal pressures. Because the subject has so many depths and anger can be expressed and influence people’s behaviour differently, the workshop was unable to tailor specific needs to individuals. However this is what Mark can do through Beating Anger Bath and runs workshops that can be tailored to individual needs. Mark runs group courses as well as one to one advice and his “Riding the Rapids” course offers individual and corporate empowerment through emotional awareness.
