This will be the longest distance to date &#8211; of one of our Twinterviews. Jerome is a licensed architect and business owner. Jerome sharpened his design skills at <a href="http://www.clivewilkinson.com/story/whatwedo.html">Clive Wilkinson Architects (CWA)</a>; known worldwide for the design of <a href="http://www.clivewilkinson.com/work/google.html">Google&#8217;s office headquarters!</a> Jerome was BALNKSPACES first customer! He left the corporate worked to set up his own freelancing business and realised he needed a place to work which accommodated his time schedule &#8211; but wasn’t in coffee shops of from home. He realised he wanted and needed a high-tech, modern, professional workplace. He now runs a co-working space that is home to the greatest percentage of independent workers in the U.S!</span><em></em><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"> Zoikes!! If you have questions about co-working culture across the ocean or are just curious about how Jerome ended up where he is now, his idea and how he came to implement them &#8211; then <a href="https://twitter.com/OldChurchSchool">Tweet</a> us a question and we&#8217;ll be sure to ask! </span> </span></span></p>

Great! However, what if you feel uncertain about how to proceed &#8211; in other words &#8211; how to get clients? As a new freelancer or business owner, you&#8217;re sure to be an eager beaver and get the concept of your business into a money making enterprise!  What are the pros and cons of starting out that face you as a newbie?<br />
</span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>First things first:</strong> Have you done your research? What are your rates? Will you charge for extra work? How do you want to get paid &#8211; hourly, on a day rate or per project? How will you agree to projects or set up appointments? Why not find out what the market average is in your area and charge a similar amount. If you&#8217;re going for high end work &#8211; do you charge clients more than the &#8216;going rate&#8217;?  Here is a great blog <a href="http://www.startups.co.uk/pricing-your-work.html">post </a>about  how to price your services. It has a comprehensive list of what to take into account. </span></span></p>
<p><strong>Know who you&#8217;re working for:</strong> As a fail-safe shouldn&#8217;t you have an idea of who it is you&#8217;re going to be working with for the next chapter in your life? Make sure you know the basics about your new customer. What is your client’s name? Registered business name? Billing address? Contact numbers? Email address? Make sure you share the same information about yourself in your contract as well; so the client knows where and when they can contact you. Why not mention what you don&#8217;t do &#8211; as well as what you do, do. That way you&#8217;re upfront from the beginning and not caught in the trap of doing work you don&#8217;t really want to be doing to stay afloat.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Contacting clients:</strong> How do you intend to communicate with clients? Email, postal docs, phone? Be aware that although email is the standard way of communicating (and can often be perceived as being informal), anything you say or agree to could be seen as being &#8216;set in stone&#8217;. This is a great<a href=" http://contractclarity.co.uk/articles/beware-the-binding-email/"> article</a> about email and the legal connotations to your written word!<br style="font-size: small;" /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Do you want to get paid at the end of the day?</strong> Do you let people tell you that you have to work for free or assign yourself to a low-paying job -  if you want to crack into your chosen industry?  If you don&#8217;t take the job, there well may be a hundred more freelancers behind you willing to take that position, so why not let them and hold out for something that you feel deserves your time and expertise?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>To do or not to do:</strong> Once you&#8217;ve started up, many friends and family will cotton on on the fact you have these skills and may suggest you &#8216;do them a favour&#8217;. No one can blame you for wanting to lend a hand to your family or &#8216;a friend of a friend&#8217;. But ask yourself this&#8230;Will you have a good word of mouth recommendation after the work is complete? Or will helping out a mate actually burn a friendship and end up with a job you&#8217;re not too happy with? Before you embark on this &#8216;informal&#8217; work, why not just put a few things in place to cover your back &#8211; and your client&#8217;s. That way you both know what to expect from one another. Some freelancers have told us how they&#8217;ve been burned by doing a favour for a friend, where sadly communications were misunderstood and they&#8217;ve not come out of the situation favourably through no fault of their own, other than that they didn&#8217;t treat it as a job. Have a look at these <a href="http://speckyboy.com/2010/08/12/5-free-to-use-freelance-design-contract-templates/">5 Free to Use Freelance Design Contract Templates</a> to figure out what suits you.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Why not start as you mean to go on:</strong> Be as professional as you can be. Make sure you understand and research common practices in your chosen freelancing industry. Check out these quick start guides<a href="http://freelancefolder.com/getting-started-guides/ "> here</a>.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Get paid for the time you put in:</strong> Should you include a retainer fee in a contract?  Don&#8217;t under estimate hours of concept time that you&#8217;ll put into a project at the beginning. An up front fee ensures that you are actually paid for all the work that you&#8217;ve done up to the point the client notifies you that they&#8217;re not going to continue on with the project. This could be down to any number of things &#8211; but you don&#8217;t want to end up forking out on the project only to have the rug pulled out from underneath you, with no job or money in the bank! Just because you are a fledgling in a world of established freelancers &#8211; doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t command respect from the get-go!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><span><strong>Have you thought about insurance?</strong> Could the advice you give or work you do cause someone a mischief if interpreted the wrong way? It is always best to cover yourself &#8211; so your loved ones or dog won&#8217;t go hungry. Check out this <a href="http://3.kpsol.co.uk/what_insurances_do_i_need.html#do_i_really_need_insurance">link</a> to see an overview of the various types of insurance you may need as a Director, employer or freelancer. Check out this <a href="http://www.freelancesupermarket.com/resources/contractor-faqs/what-insurance-do-i-need/print.aspx ">list </a>for a breakdown of all things you may need to insure against as a small business owner!</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget the paperwork:</strong> HMRC related paperwork can build up before you you know it &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re an employer. Make sure you familiarise yourself with all that is required of you. Living the dream means being super responsible for it too. Here is a <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payerti/getting-started/paye-basics/rti.htm">guide</a> to the new &#8216;real time&#8217; PAYE basics.  These <a href="http://www.freelanceuk.com/news/3927.shtml">tips</a> are also useful for knowing what you need to think about when running your freelancing career.</p>

(Sponsored by Forward space).</p>
<p>Andreas attempts to represent the role of a non-player character in the modern world. He strikes a meditative position of inactiveness to address cultural tensions rather than dealing with subjective issues. His removal of negative and positive factors from his life creates a series of rituals revealing both the boredom and the promise of spiritual transcendence inherent in contemporary society.</p>
<p>Andreas’ current work addresses the apathy towards the gradual creep of technology inserting itself into our lives. It deals with the erosion of our primal desires by structural forces that make decisions on our behalf, slowly making the natural un-natural, and then through familiarity, natural once more. It explores the creation of a synthesized utopia of flavour, sight, sound and smell to produce organic fantasies that drive product purchases.</p>
<p>“We are touching a touch screen, but we’re also touched by it. The images I take in through the screen every day affect me in a bodily way, giving me sensations that remind me of others I’ve had &#8211; touching water, rocks, moss, etc. but intense in a different way – hyper-real, simulated, glossy…”</p>
<p>Andreas Ervik lives and works in Oslo, Norway. His practice swims between a digital and physical channel. In Intimate Knowledge at The Toolshed, we will see an installation of prints, video and sculptures that reflects our current fluid transitioning between physical and virtual habitats.</p>
<p>Recent solo exhibitions include, Philophopherph Phone at Sound of Mu, Oslo, 2011 and Learning to Love my Life as a Non-Player Character, Wizard Gallery, Oslo, 2012, as well as participating in the group show Metamorphosis, Revision Arts, NY. Andreas is also part of the collaborative blog project Jogging, and had works published in Pretty Ugly, Gestalten Verlag and OFluxo #1.</p>
<p>The Toolshed is a new art gallery based in Frome, Somerset. Into its second year, it will be hosting a program of five solo shows over the summer months.</p>

Some really useful tips and insights in to the world of finance options &#8211; as well as crowdfunding! Speakers Andrew Denham, founder of <a href="http://www.thebicycleacademy.org/">The Bicycle Academy </a>and our very own <a href="http://www.forwardspace.co.uk/">Gavin Eddy</a>  gave really helpful and strong advice to attendees looking for ways to further their businesses through an external finance route. We all received great handouts from Gavin, with up to date information about what was out there &#8211; as well as a few cheeky, yet very helpful hints on receiving credit from the banks out there. We&#8217;d also like to thank venue host Nikki Davey for her generous venue and time &#8211; and The Works Canteen, who once again delivered beautiful food to share with the informal networking after the talk had finished. Anyone with questions about finance can email us or contact <a href="http://www.burton-sweet.co.uk/">Burton Sweet</a> accountants who very generously said they&#8217;d help those who attended the talk with queries about their fiances. Get in touch if you want to know anything!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="775" height="960" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mara31922_10151555050157704_1493544000_n.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="mara31922_10151555050157704_1493544000_n" title="mara31922_10151555050157704_1493544000_n" /></div><p><a href="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/P1010113.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2284" title="P1010113" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/P1010113-300x218.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="218" /></a>Well done to everyone who took part in the Bath Half yesterday! We were there to cheer some friends on, standing on the beautiful streets of Bath on the chilly day of March 3rd (2013). As always the atmosphere was great and it was amazing to see so many people running for worthy causes as well as for fun.</p>
<p>We interviewed some participants and spectators who&#8217;d also taken part in the event, after the race and got us some good tips on how to enjoy a half marathon as a competitor. Something useful for our fellow TOCSters competing in the Frome Half Marathon later in the year?</p>
<p><strong>Before the event:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Get yourself ready to go:</strong> John, 65 (who has been running in the Bath Half for the last 33 years!), recommends training well for a whole year before the race; so you can do four months of half marathon style runs leading up to the day. This way you have a level of fitness that means you can stay at a consistent pace throughout and know your pace limit. &#8220;You minimise your risk of over exerting yourself at the beginning or end of the race by ensuring you&#8217;ve put the hours in. Also make sure you eat well; carbohydrate-rich foods like homemade bread, pasta and potatoes, are a great fuel for your body. Fruit, fruit juice, low-fat milk and yogurts are great treats to have in the last few weeks leading up to the race.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://fromerunningclub.org.uk/ ">Frome Running Club</a> and others like it can help you to map out a training plan for participating in a half or full marathon and can help you with diet tips too.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Fuel your brain as well as your body:</strong> This year the organisers let competitors listen to music in one headphone, so you could enjoy the experience a bit more; but could still be able to hear information from the events marshals. We talked to Joseph, 34 a Magazine Editor who has taken part in the race for the last 3 years. He recommends sorting out a play list the day before, with something cheery and upbeat to start with and as the race gets underway making sure you have some songs that spur you on &#8211; especially at the half way mark! Joe&#8217;s top tracks were &#8220;anything by the Pogues&#8221; at the start of the race &#8211; and then gearing your list to tracks such as &#8216;Run to the Hills&#8217; by Iron Maiden; &#8216;He&#8217;s Going the Distance&#8217; by Cake and &#8216;Road to No-where&#8217; By Talking Heads, quite an eclectic mix!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 3:</strong> <strong>Give yourself some TLC:</strong> Alice, 30 a Town Planner (who has taken part in the Bath Half for two year&#8217;s now) advises you look after yourself the week before.  &#8220;Make sure you look after your feet; get a nice pedicure and a massage. Wear those comfy trainers you&#8217;ve been training in, on the big day itself. Wear comfortable socks and don&#8217;t bother investing in anything new for the event &#8211; you&#8217;ll only end up doing yourself a mischief! Get an early night every night for a week leading up to the big day and definitely stay on the water the night before &#8211; you don&#8217;t want to be running with a headache or hangover!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: You are what you wear:</strong> If you know that a few &#8220;whoops&#8221; and cheers from the crowd will keep you going when you need it<span> &#8211; <span>p</span>ut your name on your vest! &#8220;<span>People watching the race are really supportive<span>, </span>especially in the <span>last mile and have great respect for you taking part. It&#8217;ll gi<span>ve you that last push you need and get the <span>adrenaline</span> going again! Also wear clothes that are made for running in, nothing too fancy &#8211; but anything heavy or pure cotton might give you a sore patch!</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>&#8221; Ian, 29 &#8211; a first timer this year!  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>On the day:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5:<strong> Always eat a good breakfast:</strong> </strong>Says Cameron 21 a Student: Get up early and eat at least two to three hours before the start time. This gives your body time to digest your meal and gives you the energy you need for the day ahead. You can feel quite nauseous after the event, so by looking after yourself you run less risk of fainting or being ill later that day.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 6:<strong> Stretch out any nerves:</strong> </strong>Rebekah, 52 said to make sure you warm up before the race &#8211; do some gentle exercise and stretches to prepare your body for the task ahead, that way you minimise the risk of pulling anything!</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Tip 7: <strong>Be prepared: </strong></strong>According to Anna, 28, it&#8217;s a great idea to take a bum-bag. &#8220;Fill it with the essential goodies; energy tablets or sweets and any vital medication you might need. There are stops for you to have a drink &#8211; but it&#8217;s best to take a small bottle if you know running makes you thirsty. Don&#8217;t over do the water though, just go by what you&#8217;ve needed when training &#8211; otherwise you&#8217;ll get caught at the roadside if you can&#8217;t cross your legs any longer!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><strong></strong></strong><strong><strong>Tip 8:</strong> Steady on:</strong> Mary, 43 says that keeping the same pace throughout is her key tip! She&#8217;s taken part for two year&#8217;s now and really enjoys the atmosphere of the event. &#8220;If you start of slow then you lose precious time at the beginning and may find it hard to make up those lost minutes during the race. If you can, maintain a good solid pace all the way to the finish line. It&#8217;s no easy task, but if you put in the practice it&#8217;s the best way to perform on the day! You don&#8217;t need to do a rush at the end when you&#8217;re feeling tired if you&#8217;ve managed to do the same pace all along and keep an eye on the time (if it&#8217;s important to you!).&#8221;<br clear="all" /><br />
<strong>Tip 9: Find a friend:</strong> Jen, 36:  &#8220;If it&#8217;s your first time and you&#8217;re a bit nervous, buddy up with someone you know who is also taking part. If you need to stop don&#8217;t just stop running whilst in the crowd &#8211; as you&#8217;ll end up hurting yourself and others. Instead make a beeline for the pavement and take a short rest if you&#8217;re starting to feel overwhelmed. Take off any unwanted layers too. Organisers recommend you buy an old sweatshirt or top from a charity shop and leave these items on the pavement for volunteers and marshals to collect after the event is over. These are then recycled. Some people use black bin-liners, but this can make running uncomfortable and you can get them wrapped around your legs when taking them off, not a good look!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>After the event:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tip 10: Know where to go:</strong> Tom 33, says his best tip is to arrange to meet your friends and family at the end (before you start the race). This doesn&#8217;t have to be at the finish line &#8211; as this can be quite a hectic spot. &#8220;Choose somewhere near by that is easily accessible, this way you can relax and take your time getting there. Having family keep hold of your belongings means that if it&#8217;s cold like it was this year, then you have an instant change of clothes and can cool down with out freezing your legs off!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tip 11: Cool down slowly:</strong> Be sure to keep moving after the race. Go for a little walk and keep stretching to make sure you gently let your body recover. Sip some water and wind down slowly. If you feel up to it have a light lunch and then rest. After you feel better go for a little walk again to keep things moving. &#8220;Don&#8217;t drink alcohol for a good few hours afterwards &#8211; your body will need time to rehydrate itself. I made the mistake of having a couple of pints to celebrate my victory and deeply regretted it later. I was in bed the rest of the afternoon with a headache, that was many years ago &#8211; and I&#8217;ve not competed since!&#8221; Peter, 50, a Partner in a regional Law firm.</p>

The glass meeting rooms? The beautiful Herman Miller chairs? Our Mozzo Coffee? TILT Desk space and printing facilities? Actually most of the time, it is absolutely none of the above!</p>
<p>The desk space and office facilities we offer are secondary to how someone is feeling about their current work situation. For some; the need to get out of their current office rental or homeworking arrangement brings them to our front door, or a voice at the end of our telephone. Others are working from home and fancy a bit of balance with their work lifestyle. Some have been offered homeworking arrangements by the boss &#8211; that are too far away removed from the buzz of a more traditional work environment. We can&#8217;t say we are a traditional 9-5 office; because we simply are not.</p>
<p>We have Cake Wednesday &#8211; where each week we make cake to celebrate it being&#8230;well a Wednesday. We have competitions; community events; workshops; members events; National Chip Week celebrations; pop up restaurants in our meeting rooms; business festivals and bake offs. Traditional we may not be, but we understand why people need this stuff. Because at the end of the day, co-working actually provides much more emotional fulfillment than practical. <strong></strong></p>
<p>What members say they are interested in most when they sign up to rent desk space is a sense of community. Of belonging and knowing they are going through the same work or home difficulties as everyone else, even if it&#8217;s just checking in one day a month.</p>
<p>Desk space is obviously the practical reason for coming to us. But beneath this initial interest is a deeper process. An awareness and evaluation of holistic needs, not just desk space.</p>
<p>We are in no way saying homeworking is bad, it works for so many people and th<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/06/working-from-home-miss-office">e 5.4 million British households</a> with one or more occupants working from home is testament to how this working style can be a positive lifestyle choice. It&#8217;s simply for some, a change of scenery is the right path for them.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we offer free trail days &#8211; to everyone! If you feel it is not for you, great. You are a happy homeworker, or your office rental suits you just fine! If you want to come and work in our space, great! Welcome aboard. How can we help you? Cake?</p>
