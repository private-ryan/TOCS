			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="700" height="1050" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_9501.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="IMG_9501" title="IMG_9501" /></div><p>Co-working is about changing the existing rules of work. Freeing up time limits and laws of convention, to better suit the world of work, that we now live in. Work and lifestyle is now much more interchangeable, and co-working is a great way to achieve this way of life.</p>
<p>So what are the differences between a serviced office and a co-working space?</p>
<p><strong>Co-working space</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open plan space</li>
<li>Shared community</li>
<li>Sign up online…that’s it!</li>
<li>Pay as you go/flexible tariffs</li>
<li>No upfront payments</li>
<li>Change or stop when you want to</li>
<li>A host that cares about your business</li>
<li>Focus on openness, collaboration and sustainability</li>
<li>Fun and specialized</li>
<li>Optional services that you choose to pay extra for</li>
<li>Bring your dog, hamster or goldfish to work</li>
<li>Family friendly</li>
<li>Daily learning experiences</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Traditional office space </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Separate offices</li>
<li>Working alone</li>
<li>Formal application process</li>
<li>Contracted lease and rental period</li>
<li>Deposit and rent upfront</li>
<li>Restricted by your contract</li>
<li>Relationship=landlord-tenant</li>
<li>Focus on office amenities</li>
<li>Work, work, work</li>
<li>Additional services &#8211; at a price</li>
<li>No pets allowed!</li>
<li>A place to work</li>
<li>9-5 Workplace</li>
</ul>
<p>Spot the difference? A co-working space is about a business community and developing your business further; through a nurturing environment. Office space is an empty space to rent and base your business.</p>

<p>Openstorytellers is a Frome based charity and social enterprise. This unique organisation was created to enrich the lives of children, and adults with learning and communication difficulties, using traditional stories and personal narrative. They work internationally, across the UK and especially concentrate on projects in the South West. They help people have a voice: to be heard, understood and to broaden the opportunities available to them – to have choices. Vicki says <em>“I work with adults with learning disabilities who spend their whole lives feeling different and have to deal with prejudice around these issues. Sometimes they will literally hide away to avoid this.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I’ve always been lucky having lots of hair and am known as the one with the big red hair! This has come in useful as I’ve had bouts of alopecia all my life and managed to style my hair over the bald patches. Recently I’ve lost quite a lot more and have been wearing a lovely hair piece for a few months, unnoticed by most. However I am now at the point where my hair is falling more rapidly &#8211; It’s time I stopped worrying about looking different! So please make my decision to come out of hiding worthwhile.”</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="1200" height="900" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1020236.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="P1020236" title="P1020236" /></div><p>Freelancing is essentially selling your talent, skills and time, by working for somebody else for a set time, under a fixed contract. Typically work is paid by the hour, though contracts with a fixed rate is also a possibility. So what should you consider when you want to become a freelancer in your field of expertise?</p>
<p><strong>Slow and steady wins the race…</strong><br />
In the land of the lancer; it takes a lot of time and effort to build a name for yourself, so when freelancing its best to choose something that you’re really passionate about. This will keep you motivated and if you have that genuine passion for your work, you’ll stand out from the crowd and draw in new opportunities &#8211; just by being yourself!</p>
<p><strong>Identify yourself!</strong><br />
Even a one man band can have a mission statement! What interests you? Why does your business exist? What is your work ethic? What have you got that is different from anybody else?</p>
<p><strong>Know who you want to work with…</strong><br />
Who has the riches to pay you? Who would your ideal client be? Which people or businesses will be likely to need your skills and abilities? By defining yourself you’re highlighting your micro niche, yes by doing this you are excluding some business &#8211; however, you’re increasing your appeal to the market you want to be in!</p>
<p><strong>Cross the “t&#8221;s and dot the… lower case “j&#8221;s…</strong><br />
No one really likes dealing with legalities, lawyers or solicitors, however…having an official agreement in place for each job can make it easier when you face a tricky client or non-payment! This also safeguards you if any glitches arise-it’s always better to be safe than sorry!</p>
<p><strong>Don’t hold back!</strong><br />
When setting your rates, don’t think being the cheapest, will guarantee work. Set a budget for a job, on the basis of your time and your talent. If you’re professional, warm and polite and always deliver quality work on the dot, then clients will come back to you and they’ll no doubt recommend you to a friend! Setting a fair price for yourself is fair for both you and the client -it shows self belief and integrity in your work!</p>
<p><strong>Got the work, but ain’t got the money?</strong><br />
Don’t let it be a constant struggle to pay the bills! One word will help you enjoy being a freelancer…Invoicing! It doesn’t have to be a tactical minefield, be clear when you want payment for your work. Be reliable in your invoicing-it’s wise to be consistent, sending out invoices on the same day of each month, or expect payment upon completion of work. State clearly when it is you expect to be paid, with a deadline for payment. Accounting software like Xero (and other software like it) will become your new best friend for an invoicing and accounting system!</p>
<p><strong>Be friends with the competition!</strong><br />
Get to know other freelancers or similar businesses in your area. Why not ask if you can help them out with any up and coming jobs? Alternatively when you have too much work on the go, why not pass it on to your new found business chums and get some time to re-charge your batteries?</p>
<p><strong>Play a part in a greater scheme…</strong><br />
Why not innovate with a fellow freelancer? Design an ebook, launch a free advice/knowledge based website or develop a new product or app. It will get you noticed and you’ll no doubt gain a new skill set and benefit from the experience. It’s also a great marketing opportunity!</p>
<p><strong>Don’t put all your eggs in one basket!</strong><br />
Whether you like to or not, as a freelancer you’ll have to do many more things than just doing the work you enjoy! You’ll have to get to grips with bookkeeping and accounting, managing a business, marketing yourself, pitching for jobs and a hundred and one things besides! Freelanceswith.com is a great website for all the things you’ll ever need to know about freelancing.</p>
<p>We have many amazing freelancers here at TOCS, all with something unique about them! You can check em’ out here!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="1200" height="800" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_6721.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="IMG_6721" title="IMG_6721" /></div><p>The world of work is a really exciting place right now, and small businesses have the best of both worlds. You can choose where and how you want to work and run your business, and there is a wealth of flexibility out there-if you know where to look!</p>
<p>As a small business you’ll need to think big-but at times, it’s Okay to think small too! It can be difficult to predict overheads in the next 12 months, let alone 5 years, when planning financial forecasts. Why not think day to day or month to month with your office space?</p>
<p>Co-working or shared office space is perfectly suited to new businesses. Why? Because it gives you control over spending what you do and do not want to fork out on office space. Tariff based “pay as you go” space is great when you want your start-up functioning ASAP, without any loss of time or money, on searching for office space and setting up. By joining a shared space, your business can get more than a work place; you can connect with other small and larger businesses.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1020234.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1059" title="P1020234" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1020234-300x227.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="227" /></a>A co-working space allows you to learn from others, get inspiration for your business and even collaborate with others to advance your business. So what’s the catch? Well there isn’t one; a good co-working space should be transparent with what you get from them, and you are in control! Just sign up and rock up at your desk. Book online, pay online, it’s a clean and simple paperless system. Here at The Old church School our range of tariffs are there to be flexible enough to change when a business needs them to. Providing stability in changeable industries or freelance based work. The pay as you go office, also gives you peace of mind.</p>
<p>Do you really want to be adding to your to do list? Business rates, electricity, gas, waste collection, cleaning charges…with tariff based office space you don’t have to think of this.</p>
<p>So what’s in it for us? Its fun, exciting and we want you to succeed in your new venture! We get to meet new amazing people every day, with a story to tell-about how they got here, about how they’re changing their lives (or the world!) with their start-up, and we love being a part of that story! Don’t see a tariff that’s quite right for you? Why not get on touch and tell us what we’ve missed! hello@forwardspace.co.uk</p>
