We managed to collect quite a selection of prizes from several generous sponsors for our tombola, including: <a href="http://www.cobblewobble.co.uk">The Cobble Wobble</a>, <a href="http://www.diningdivas.co.uk">Divas Cafe</a>, <a href="http://www.droollery.co.uk/#">Droollery</a>, Rak Textiles and Gavin Eddy. We rearranged the lounge to house coffee, cake and prize giving for all of those who had entered the tombola (and even some who hadn&#8217;t).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Everyone enjoyed themselves, and we managed to raise over £110 for MacMillan which we&#8217;re really happy about.

The idea is to monitor our usage over the coming weeks, to make us more aware of what we can do to reduce the amount of energy we waste.</p>
<p>We have put up posters from &#8216;The Carbon Trust&#8217; to encourage all TOCS&#8217;ters as much as possible, and asked everyone to be extra conscious of their usage (especially over the next few weeks). It&#8217;s quite interesting looking at the meter, and seeing how much it increases as each person comes into the building and starts work.</p>
<p>The scheme was brought to us by Simon Hill, who is &#8220;Analysing the influence of didactic interventions within building on occupant behaviour, and the association with sustainability&#8221;.</p>
<p>We try to be as eco- friendly as we can, setting an example for other local businesses and work hubs. We hope this study gives us more ideas on how to improve our efficiency, to improve the environment for everyone.</p>

The Double Robotics is based on the Segway, it allows you to remotely control your iPad (From another iPad) and drive it around it&#8217;s surroundings. It is height adjustable so you can always maintain eye-level conversation and runs from rechargeable batteries so there aren&#8217;t any trailing wires.</p>
<p>It is a simple, elegant and interactive solution to dealing with clients/ employees from anywhere in the world. For more information visit their site: <a href="http://www.doublerobotics.com" target="_blank">Double Robotics</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="2047" height="3004" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1000345.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="P1000345" title="P1000345" /></div><p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This month&#8217;s piece is on Chris Anderson&#8217;s article in Wired UK, titled <em>“It used to be hard to be an Entrepreneur”</em>. Obviously quite a controversial title, Anderson is referring to the influence technology has had on business and the availability of information.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Anderson opens the article by focussing on the inventors and businessmen of the industrial revolution. Having a good idea wasn&#8217;t the only ingredient needed to become an entrepreneur, social class also played a vital role in the success of a start-up. You needed to be born into the upper class or become an apprentice to someone who was, otherwise your chance were severely restricted. Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean that you couldn&#8217;t have revolutionised the world with your idea, it just meant that it was a whole lot more difficult to do so. Another interesting idea is that the cost of failure has fallen, before failure meant lifelong disgrace, whereas now you end up with a few overdue credit card bills!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One of the most important factors the internet has provided, is the access to a large audience with relative ease. By simply sharing your idea online, it opens it up to thousands of potential customers, all at a click of a button. Which means you can receive feedback on your business plan from strangers all over the world without ever leaving your desk.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Another benefit technology has provided is the ability to model products on the computer. This has had a huge impact on the invention process. It is possible to quickly build your idea and see if it is mechanically sound without wasting any materials (or potential profits), meaning the final product is ready to go to market.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The increase in efficiency, the possibility to reach a nearly unlimited audience and the ease that this can be done all reinforce Anderson&#8217;s quote <em>“Computers amplify human potential”</em>. Although this isn’t entirely true, it is obvious why he says this and to a certain extent he is right.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">However this has had detrimental affects to the availability of jobs. The same task previously done by a small team of workers can now be completed by an automated system to the same or better standard. This obviously is great news for the manufacturer, but devastating to the local communities who are built around the employers. Therefore, start ups are a vital source of income and employment, especially in the current economic climate. A survey taken in 2010 showed that Small to Medium- sized businesses contributed 44% to new employment opportunities.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Currently the digital economy is worth £13 Trillion (which is a lot considering it doesn&#8217;t physically exist), however the <em>“real”</em> economy beyond the web is valued at £84 Trillion. Which is reassuring, but the gap will become undoubtably smaller, as more objects than ever contain electronics to quench our thirst for total synchronisation.</span></span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Everyone deserves to leap out of bed in the morning with a sense of excitement and anticipation.</span></span></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="752" height="1023" src="http://www.theoldchurchschool.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/vjp5e.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="vjp5e" title="vjp5e" /></div><p><a name="_GoBack"></a></p>
<p>I have recently started as an Apprentice here with The Old Church School, which is very exciting and has opened my eyes to the wonderful world of co- working! A copy of Wired magazine landed on my desk and I decided to have a flick through. Inside I found a wide range of articles, on an even wider range of topics. One article in particular that grabbed my attention was Oliver Burkeman’s <em>“You’ll be dead soon, isn’t that great?”</em> which focuses on society’s attitude towards death and mortality.</p>
<p>Burkeman’s matter of fact attitude towards the subject allows you to draw your own conclusions, but it does make you realise that death has become a social taboo. With the media being so obsessed with looking and feeling young, it’s no wonder it’s a sensitive subject.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs was a firm believer in the <em>“Memento Mori”</em> tradition; which is Latin for <em>“remember you will die”.</em> When addressing graduate students at Stanford University he famously said <em>“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve encountered to help me make the big choices in life”</em>. I find it interesting that he chose to tell young graduates this, as they are at the beginning of their lives, but I’m sure that quote will stick with them forever.</p>
<p>Even Montaigne thought writers should work with a view of a graveyard; as it tends to sharpen the mind, Gavin obviously had this in mind when choosing a location for the Frome Work hub!</p>
<p>After reading the article I was curious to see if there was any scientific proof that would support this, but after a brief dig around the Internet I was unable to find anything. However, it is logical to think that a reminder of mortality would focus the mind, as most humans are sub- consciously programmed to preserve life. I feel that by accepting death, it allows you to enjoy life as much as possible, pushing you to make the big decisions and take risks.</p>
